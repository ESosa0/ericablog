### What is it?

Pair My Dish is an app that recommends a wine pairing for the dish that you are cooking. The user answers a series of five simple questions and the app returns a customized wine pairing suggestion. 

I built Pair My Dish as my final project at Ironhack, an 8-week coding bootcamp. At the end of every bootcamp, a panel of judges choose the top five technically-sound projects to compete in the Hackshow. At the Hackshow, the audience chooses their favorite project. Pair My Dish was chosen by the tech-panel as one of the top five, then was selected by the audience of the Hackshow as the winner. I put a lot of hard work and love into this app and I’m very honored and proud that it won.

### Why wine?

I am a food and wine enthusiast. I cook all the time and I’m very adventurous with the food I eat. I also studied food and wine pairing at the top culinary school in Chicago. I see a lot of people struggle with food and wine pairing, so I wanted to create an app that would help them. I also wanted to build an app that I would be passionate about. So I used wine pairing methodology to create a wine-pairing algorithm.

### Was it hard?

There were many challenges I came across in this project, both mentally and technically. As this was the final project in the bootcamp, I only had two weeks to build it. I had only been using 
rails for 6 weeks and I had to create a database with many different association types, build an API and make Ajax calls, and design a responsive and visually appealing user interface. All new to me and all in two weeks. I worked on the app 12 hours a day, hit many roadblocks along the way, but ultimately succeeded in my goal.

### What's next for Pair My Dish?

There are many improvement I’d like to make and I plan making. Some of these are: further refining the algorithm to become even more specific, integrating with a wine-selling API to make bottles available for purchase, and providing recommendations by location using a geolocator. In a perfect world in which I have unlimited time and resources, I would like to turn this into software for restaurants with quickly rotating seasonal menus or as a tool for home chefs who frequently host dinner parties.
