#It's {{ 'now' | date: "%Y" }} and a girl's gotta blog, amiright?

A long time ago I had a travel blog. Then I got weirded out by people reading it and I deleted it. Now I realize you're supposed to "be seen" on the internet, promote yourself, be your own brand, blah blah blah. Ok, I'm not gonna lie, I still kinda hate all that.

BUT, the blogging part is actually really fun. Especially a tech blog. It's so impersonal that I don't need to constantly filter myself. In fact, at some point I decided, #nofilter. I'm just gonna write down everything. Everything I learn today, put it in the blog. I don't care how basic or trivial. Let this be a tech diary of sorts, keeping track of all my moves, so that in a year, two years, three years, I can say DAMN I've learned a lot.

And I'm no longer weirded out by people reading my blog. In fact, I welcome it :)
